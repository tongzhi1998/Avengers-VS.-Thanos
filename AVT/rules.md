1.All code was written in Eclipse.Make sure that you have MySQL and Eclipse installed in your computer. This program can only be run in localhost.                             
2.To run the program, simply pull the whole folder down and use Tomcat to run WebContent/loading.html. Make sure that you change the SQL password and username to your customized setting in your computer (In src/backend/LoginServlet.java line 21; src/backend/DirectServlet.java line 23; src/backend/GameEndServlet.java line 21). 
3. Make Sure to clear the SQL database every time when you try to rerun the game, since the registered username and game room won't disappear as the game ends.
4.Have fun playing our game!!!
